# BankTransactionSystem
Bank Transaction System on Asp.Net Core using MVC CRUD Operations with EF Core

This is a demo project that I used for showing CRUD Operations ( Insert, Update, Delete, and Retrieve) with the latest ASP.NET Core 6.0 MVC using Entity Framework Core and SQL Server DB.

Points discussed :
- Create MVC Project
- Define EF Core Model
- Dependency Injection
- DB Connection String
- Database Migration
- Create MVC Controller
- Layout Page
- Insert Operation
- Form Validation in MVC
- Form Submission
- Display Existing Records
- Update Operation
- Delete Operation
